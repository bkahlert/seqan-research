<h2>Flexbar â€” flexible barcode and adapter removal</h2>

Flexbar is a software to preprocess high-throughput sequencing data efficiently. It demultiplexes barcoded runs and removes adapter sequences. Moreover, trimming and filtering features are provided. Flexbar increases mapping rates and improves genome and transcriptome assemblies. It supports next-generation sequencing data from Illumina, Roche 454, and the SOLiD platform. Recognition is based on exact overlap sequence alignment.

### Program usage ###

Usage of program on command line:

		flexbar -t target -f format -r reads [-b barcodes] [-a adapters] [options]
<div vspace="1"></div>

#### Required parameters ####

Mandatory parameters:

* input file with reads
* input format of reads
* target name for output prefix


#### Format of reads ####
Choose the format that matches your sequencing data. The fastq format has different quality scalings, which should be specified for quality based trimming of reads. The "cs" is an abbreviation for color-space. In case of csfastq, Flexbar assumes sanger quality scaling. The output format is the same as the format of input.

Supported read formats:

* fasta
* fastq
* fastq-sanger
* fastq-solexa
* fastq-illumina1.3
* fastq-illumina1.5
* fastq-illumina1.8
* csfasta
* csfastq

#### Barcodes and adapters ####
To detect barcodes or remove adapter sequences from sequencing reads, specify barcodes and adapter(s) in addition. Create a fasta file containing barcodes or adapter sequences to be detected. Tag names (e.g. adapter1) can be chosen freely:

     >adapter1
     TCGATTACGT
     >adapter2
     GGTAGTACGCTA

Except for reads in color space format, the wildcard character 'N' can be used in barcodes and adapters to virtually match all characters in letter space. Run Flexbar, for example with 4 threads for parallel computation:

		flexbar -t output -f fastq -r reads.fastq -a adapters.fasta -n 4

Flexbar aligns each read from file.fastq to the adapter sequences found in adapters.fasta one by one based on global alignment. For each read, the highest scoring valid alignment is employed for adapter removal. In case of reads in color-space format, barcodes and adapters are automatically converted from letter-space. Color-space reads typically begin with an artificial starting reference base and a first transition T1. The first two characters are not taken into account during alignment. The output will contain the first two characters again. This is necessary to allow an overlap of the adapter sequence and the read start.

#### Paired reads ####
Flexbar natively processes paired reads and outputs consistent read files after processing. If single reads are left over, they are written to an extra file. To use paired reads, specify two input files that are in correct order for paired reads:

		flexbar -r s_1_1.fastq -p s_1_2.fastq -f fastq -t output [options]

Output files output_1.fastq and output_2.fastq that contain processed reads are created.

#### Barcoded reads ####
To detect barcodes within reads, specify barcodes file when running Flexbar:

		flexbar -r barcoded_reads.fastq -b barcodes.fasta -f fastq -t output [options]

This generates several output files for each barcode being contained in the barcode fasta file, where fasta tags are used in filename:

	 output_barcodeA.fastq
	 output_barcodeB.fastq ...
<div vspace="1"></div>

#### Separate barcode reads ####
Illumina produces two output files for single barcoded and three for paired-end barcoded runs:

	 s_1.fastq - containing sequencing reads (1st read of the pair)
	 s_2.fastq - separate barcode reads
	 s_3.fastq - containing 2nd read of the pair (optional)

Run Flexbar with these files:

		flexbar -r s_1.fastq -p s_3.fastq -b barcodes.fasta -br s_2.fastq -f fastq -t output

For each barcode several output files are generated:

	 output_barcodeA_1.fastq (s_1.fastq reads with barcode A)
	 output_barcodeA_2.fastq (s_3.fastq reads with barcode A)
	 output_barcodeB_1.fastq ...
<div vspace="1"></div>

### Detection parameters ###
Parameters for detection and removal of barcodes as well as adapters:

#### Trim-end modes ####
Further, parameters --barcode-trim-end and --adapter-trim-end are important. These options refer to the barcode or adapter position within the read and specify which part of the read gets removed in barcode or adapter removal.

The following illustrations explain the five different modes. When a barcode or adapter aligns in agreement with the threshold and min-overlap, it could still be rejected due to restriction by trim-end mode. <span style="color:#FF0000">Red</span> indicates a non-valid match and no removal of sequence from the read. <span style="color:#4876FF">Blue</span> indicates removal of corresponding read sequence. <span style="color:#4CBB17">Green</span> highlights the remaining sequence of the read after removal. The aligned barcode or adapter sequence is depicted by Xs.

ANY mode: longer part of read remains

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color:#4876FF">XXXXXX</span><span style="color:#4CBB17">---------</span>
</code>

Options --barcode-tail-length and --adapter-tail-length can be used to modify the length of the tail mode region to be considered.

#### Min-overlap ####
The minimum required overlap for barcodes is set to their length per default and to one base-pair for adapters. It can be a drawback to set the min-overlap parameter to high, if adapter sequences are mostly located at the end of reads. Therefore Flexbar uses a very low default value. Run for example:

		flexbar -r test.fasta -f fasta -t result -a adapters.fasta -ao 5 -l ALL

Assume a simple adapter like AAAAAA and a min-overlap of 5. The adapter would be recognized in the following read:

		TCGAAAAAAGCGTGTTT
		   ||||||
		---AAAAAA--------

If the adapter is located at the 3' end, but only with 4 bases the adapter would not be removed, because we specified a min-overlap of 5 and only 4 bases match the read. With a lower min-overlap value adapters can be better detected at read ends. In default behaviour min-overlap is set to a low value and the adapter will be removed.

		TCGGCGTGTTTAAAA
		           ||||
		-----------AAAAAA
<div vspace="1"></div>

#### Threshold ####
The threshold parameters specifies how many mismatches and indels are allowed for an adapter or barcode sequence to be removed. Consider the following alignment:

		ACGTAGCCGTACTGT
       	       |||| |
		-------CGTATT--

We have 1 mismatches in 6 bases. If we select an adapter-threshold of 1 error per 10 bases, only 0.6 errors are allowed per 6 bases (the overlap). The adapter is not removed. By increasing the threshold to 2 we allow 1.2 errors per 6 bases and therefore the adapter gets removed. For min-overlap we choose 6 or lower. Otherwise the adapter never gets removed.

		flexbar -t result -f fasta -r test.fasta -a adapters.fasta -at 2 -ao 6 -l ALL
<div vspace="1"></div>

#### Alignment scoring ####
The alignment scoring scheme can be adjusted for detection of barcodes and adapters separately. This includes match, mismatch and gap scores. For example, it could make sense to specify a larger score for gaps, when the data's sequencing platform has high indel error rates. See program options section for information on how to set them for barcodes or adapters. If the gap score is set to a value of -4 for example, it means that a gap's score corresponds to 4 mismatches and can be compensated by 4 matches:

		flexbar -t result -f fasta -r test.fasta -a adapters.fasta --adapter-gap -4
<div vspace="1"></div>


### Filtering and trimming ###
Flexbar provides several basic read filtering and trimming features.

#### Filtering uncalled bases ####
In the first step, reads that contain more uncalled bases than specified are discarded. These reads are not included in further processing steps and the output. Per default not a single uncalled base is allowed. For example, to allow not more than 2 uncalled bases per read, run:

		flexbar -t target -f fastq -r reads.fastq --max-uncalled 2
<div vspace="1"></div>

#### Trimming of read ends ####
Trimming a fixed number of bases at left and right read ends is the next step, which is not performed with standard settings. For example, to trim 5 bases at the left side of reads:

		flexbar -t target -f fastq -r reads.fastq --pre-trim-left 5
<div vspace="1"></div>

#### Quality based trimming ####
The trimming step based on phred quality values helps to deal with higher error rates towards the end of reads. For example, to trim the 3' end until quality offset value 30 (corresponding to 63 in sanger format) or higher is reached, specify:

		flexbar -t target -f fastq-sanger -r reads.fastq --pre-trim-phred 30
<div vspace="1"></div>

#### Trimming to read length ####
Reads can be trimmed to a certain length by cutting the right side. This step comes after barcoding and adapter removal. It is suited for cases where tools in the downstream analysis require a maximal or even an exact length of reads. For example, to cut the rigth side of reads such that reads are not longer than 50 bases, issue the following command:

    :::text
		flexbar -t target -f fastq -r reads.fastq --post-trim-length 50
<div vspace="1"></div>

#### Filtering short reads ####
There are many applications of sequencing data in which reads cannot be processed if they are too short. Therefore, we support filtering of reads based on their length. For example to discard reads that are shorter than 50 base pairs, set the minimal read length to this number. To make sure that reads have exactly a certain length, use the post-trim-length option in addition:

    :::text
		flexbar -t target -f fastq -r reads.fastq --post-trim-length 50 --min-readlength 50
<div vspace="1"></div>


### Logging and tagging ###
Flexbar serves various logging and read tagging features for inspection of alignments, and to facilitate downstream data analysis. For example, random sequence tags which allows to recognize artifacts that stem from library amplification are supported.

#### Logging alignments ####
Print the optimal sequence alignment for each read and the barcode or adapter with maximal score if it is valid. Choose either to view all such valid alignmnets (ALL) or only those being used for read modification by sequence removal (MOD). A third option (TAB) can be selected for tabular output of alignment statistics. Usage example:

    :::text
		flexbar -t target -f fastq -r reads.fastq --log-level ALL
<div vspace="1"></div>

#### Single read output ####
While processing paired reads, it is possible to run into the situation that only one of the two reads of a pair is shorter than the specified minimal read length. In this case Flexbar discards also the single read that is not too short in order to keep the two files of paired reads in sync. The single-reads option can be used to write these long enough single reads to separate files without loosing consistency for paired read output.

#### Random sequence tags ####
Random sequence tags in reads allow to recognize artifacts, e.g. stemming from amplification by PCR during preparation of the sequencing library. Such random tags can be captured with Flexbar by specifying the random-tags option, and the character N at barcode or adapter positions for which the read is supposed to contain the random sequence tag. The characters at these positions with N are extracted and get subsequently appended to the read name, separated by underscore.

#### Miscellaneous options ####
The option fasta-output forces non-quality file formats fasta and csfasta for output. For example, this option is suited if the input file format is fastq, and fasta output is preferred. Furthermore, one can inspect the length ditribution of read output files by setting the option flag length-dist, which leads to the generation of a length distribution file for each read output file. The number-tags option triggers replacement of read name tags by an ascending number to save space. The removal-tags option can be employed to tag reads for which adapter or barcode removal takes place.
