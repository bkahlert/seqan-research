Work-Step Unit
* too high to get an easy understanding or the functioning
- Iterators too verbose (TP problem?)
- too many ways to accomplish things (missing overview?)

Online Documentation
* overview
-- esp. language entities
-- marketing wording (= also role-expressiveness)
- Dokumentation von RÃ¼ckgabewerten (TP problem?)
* Search results lacking order (grouping?)
- missing examples
- missing links to sub classes

Shortcuts
- different definitions for String, StringSet, Arrays
-- like what? String<Dna> and DnaString?

Tutorials
- good but too long

Template Programming
- return values unclear
* "ownership" of functions by classes
- metafunctions too complicated
- template parameters hard to set
- leads to copy without understanding

IO
- too complicated
