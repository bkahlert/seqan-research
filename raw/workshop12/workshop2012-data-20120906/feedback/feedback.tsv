Very clear		I like the live coding					Interesting demo					I’m noticing that of the constructs are different from what is common in the STL. This might be justified but it makes it *much* harder to learn. I guess the reason is that you want to have template functions (as in assignValue(...)) rather than methos (string.push_back). Still, it slows learning. It’ like learning a new language. It also makes it harder to read for users who are not familiar with SeqAn. Also, some operators seem to be overloaded, others are not and it’s not clear whch ones and why.			Default values for alphabets should be errors. I mean, if a letter doesn’t belong to the alphabet it should not be automaitcally converted to a default value, it should abort like taking ‘sqrt(-1)’. Otherwise, user might think he/she has a valid sequence and get wrong results.	There are 2 kinds of goNext() and the documentation is different (one for serial iterators and another for tree iterators) a bit confusing but ok.
