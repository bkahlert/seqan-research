DESCRIPTION 
-----------

	rMotifGen is a C++ program that allows users to construct DNA 
	sequences containing either randomly generated or user-defined
	motif sequences.  These sequences can be useful for simulation
	purposes, or for testing of DNA motif dectection software.

BUILDING rMotifGen
------------------ 

	rMotifGen was developed using ANSI C++.  rMotifGen uses the Makefile
	build system.  In order to create the executable, 
	type:

		make

	This will create the executable rMotifGen
____________________________________________________________________________

RUNNING rMotifGen
-----------------

        INTERACTIVE MODE

	In order to run rMotifGen in interactive mode, type:

		rMotifGen
	
	You will be prompted to enter in the number of random sequences
	to generate, which must be greater than 0 and less than 1001.
	For these sequences, you will be prompted for the length of each 
	sequence, which must be greater than 9 and less than 10001.
	For the overall sequence compostion, you will be prompted for the 
	overall percent A, C, G, and T.  Each of these must be between 0
	and 100, and the sum of all four must be equal to 100. 

	You will be prompted to enter in the number of motifs per sequence,
	which must be at least 0, and less than 11.  For each individual
	motif, the user should enter in whether the motif is (U)ser defined
	or (R)andom.  For those motifs that are user defined, you will be
	prompted for the motif consensus sequence.  If the motif is random,
	you will be prompted to determine the length of the motif, whether
	or not the motif is palindromic, and the compostion of the motif.
	For each motif, you will then be prompted for the percent conservatiton
	of the motif within each of the sequences, and then the percent
	conservation of the motif consensus in each sequence.  The
	conservation must be at least 0, and at most 100.

	The consensus for each motif will then be displayed, and the user
	will be prompted to display the sequences to the screen or to a file.
	The resulting sequences will be in FASTA format, with the first line
	containing a description of the sequence, followed by a space, followed
        by the location of each of the motifs, respectively.  If a motif was 
	not included in the sequence, it will have a position of -1.


        FILE MODE

        In order to run rMotifGen in file mode, type:

              rMotifGen <residueType> -f <infile>
  
        Where residueType is either 'N' for nucleic acids, or 'P' for
        proteins.

        The input file format will be similar for both nucleic acids and 
        proteins.  The included file AAinput.dat is an example input file for
        amino acids, and the file input.dat is an example file for nucleic
        acids.  The format for these files is LABEL=VALUE where the labels are
        found in the following order:
        numSeq=            // Number of random sequences to generate
        seqLen=            // Length of each of the random sequences
        OAPct<Residue_x>=  // Background count of residue y where
                           // y = A, C, G, T for DNA, or 
                           // y = A,R,N,D,C,Q,E,G,H,I,L,K,M,F,P,S,T,W,Y,V 
                           // for amino acids (note they must appear in this
                           // order)
        numMotifs=         // number of motifs to generate
        motif<X>Type=      // Where X=1..numMotifs --  the value can
                           // be 'U' for user defined or 'R' for random
        motif<X>Seq=       // Only Valid if Type = 'U' -- consensus motif
        motif<X>PctSeqsContain= // Percentage of sequences that contain this 
                                // motif 
        motif<X>PAM=            // PAM matrix to use (only for Amino acids)
        motif<X>PctCons=        // Percent conservation of motif consensus
                                // (only for DNA sequences)
        motif<X>Pct<Residue_y>= // Motif frequency for residue y where 
                                // y is the same as described above
        output=                 // 'F' for file, 'S' for screen
        outFile=                // only if output='F'
