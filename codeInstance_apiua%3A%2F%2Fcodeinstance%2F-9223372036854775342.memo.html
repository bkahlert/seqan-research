<p>&ldquo;I end up copying code snippets from other apps without understanding why they work and why what I initially wrote doesn&rsquo;t.&quot;</p>

<p>&ldquo;most of the time I copy code snippets that seem to do what I need. I have little understanding why in a particular place a particular form or variant or an idiom is used in place of another one.&quot;</p>
